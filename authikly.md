# W3F Open Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** authikly
* **Team Name:** Brickell Technology, LLC
* **Payment Address:** 0x2A8914A50FB93101cc7C12dA307BD14B11c1f25E

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview
  * Description: Tokenizing the value of art, art assets, and art historical and ownership information, and creating an international artisan registry.
  * By creating NFTs of real-world art, we could ensure its authenticity and rightful ownership.
  *  User cases:
  *   Use case 1: Auctions. Auction houses could register art on authikly, and upon sale, the transaction, any new relevant information, as well as new owner will be saved as an   NFT. Ownership of said NFT would be retained by the new owner, and any legal documentation would also be saved on the art pieces' NFT "folio".
  *   User case 2: Artisans. Artisans could register inventory on authikly, and upon sale, the transaction, any new relevant information, as well as new owner will be saved as     an NFT. Ownership of said NFT would be retained by the new owner, and any legal documentation would also be saved on the art pieces' NFT "folio".
  *   User case 3: Titles. NFTs may be created for real world real estate.
  *   Use case 4: Authenticators. Authenticators and restorers can add information about service and maintenance done on pieces. 
  * An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
  *  Substrate is the only technology that can quickly provide the immutable, scalable, and disparate blockchain interoperability required for authikly to efficiently document, track, and conducting value offloading of art and art assets.
  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
  *  We believe that our proposed solution has valid use cases, and therefore, can provide value to the Substrate ecosystem and to blockchain in general.


### Project Details 
*Note: Authikly is only 1 component of a larger ecosystem whose goals include democratizing human labor, and increasing artisanship and self-sufficiency in the economic future-state, which we believe will be heavily dependent on a multidiscipline (artisan and technical) and dynamic workforce (ref. Project PROME, aka Prometheus National Human Resource System, aka PROME - An Autonomous Business Resource Management Platform. Collaberation, Brickell Technology / Order of the Artisans Foundation).

Product core components and features:
1. Nonfungible Physical Asset Tokens (NPATS): 
-Public key = physical art hash (method to be determined)
-Private key = system created hash
2.NPAT art authenticity Score:
-None: Unacceptable / 0
-Hash assigned: Acceptable / 1
-Hash assigned, private hash printed, verified, and sealed: Enhanced / 2
-Hash assigned, private hash printed, verified, sealed, and held by private authorized 3rd party (service TBD, possibly safety deposit box.): Fortified / 3
-Hash assigned, private hash printed, verified, sealed, and held by private authorized 3rd party, and insured (service TBD, possibly safety deposit box.): Assured / 4
3.NPAT country of origin, fair trade verification (TBD): Can be helpful in several scenarios:
-Scenario 1: Buy [insert country] initiatives.
-Scenario 2: Buy [insert cause or conviction]. e.g. organic, free trade, etc. 
-Scenario 3: Buy [insert culture]. e.g. Persian rug, French wine, American lithographs, etc.
5. International Art Authenticity Registry (IAAR):
-Minimum information added / created (not all fields are public):
--Artist name
--Year
--Piece name
--Medium
--Style
--Description
--Image(s) of piece
--Note from the artist
*Upon sale
--Transaction information (ownership information, wallets, etc.)
--Mandatory fields (transaction type / contract type)
7. International Artisan Registry (IRA)
8. Art Sales & Logistics Network (ASLN)
9. Project Crowdfunding Token Allocation (PCTA):
-Artists can issue non-asset tokens (NATs) to raise project funds. The NATs could then aggregate value as the artist's reputation grows. The artists could increase value of NATs by individualizing them, e.g. adding a note, poem, personalizing them upon holder request (a autograph of sorts).
11. Persona UIs:
-Artisan UI (product creators)
-Customer UI (small sales and gigs)
-Collector and Supporter UI (medium plus sales, and engagements / commissions)
-Partner UI (Auction houses, government, employers, developers, etc.)
9.Smart Art: Feature enables intelligent sales terms and transactions, for example:
-Artist requiring future sales to require their authorization,
-Transfer of art requiring a complex sequence of event to occur, death, graduation, etc. In which case, a verifier would be added to smart contract, and would validate that the required events have occurred, and will add evidence to art's folio. It is assumed that the art's owner would compensate validator with an amount specified on the contract. Additional assurance may be added by adding more validators, as well as anonymous validators (a possible future-state gig).
10.Automated and intelligent estate planning, and trusts... like DAOs, or DTOs (Decentralized Trust Organizations).

* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
* What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  * This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit 

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? 
* Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
* What need(s) does your project meet? 
* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem? 
  * If so, how is your project different?
  * If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Status :open_book: 

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone â‰ˆ 1 month. 

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone, and include the approximate number of days along with the cost per day.
* _Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory_ and shall not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** 12 months to production MVP.
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  3 FTEs, Project Manager / Architect, Senior Developer, UI Developer
* **Total Costs:** 3 FTEs required for project completion:
*  3(1980*$130)= $772,200 total project labor costs
-$130 rate calculation: 3/($145+$128+$116) (enterprise architect, senior developer, UI developer rates respectivly, ref. GSA https://calc.gsa.gov/).
-The goal will be to use free labor whenever / whereever possible, e.g. interns, voulenbteers, etc., in order to reduce costs. Current funding is dependant on executive investments.
